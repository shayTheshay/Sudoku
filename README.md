The game has two parts: 
 - Tutorial

Tutorial:
Contains a thourough explanation of the rules, with a tutorial game in a lesser difficulty.

Game:
The game is of greater difficulty containing less starting numbers.

How to play:
The game will guide you through how to play but you need to use the commandPrompt to send the value of the row, column and value you want to enter in order to change a value
Please notice that in order to delete a value you can enter the value of 0 in the row, column you want to delete that value.

About the game:
 - When you win the game your score is added for how many games you want to play in that particular session.
 - The algorithm used for creating the sudoku is randomized and can contain all possible sudoku
 - All of the game is developed in a way that allows for different sizes - for now only 9 and 16 are possible but the printing is not adjacent to 16(might be implemented in future update)
 - The game was developed with C, and contains The following libraries:
   stdio.h
   time.h
   stdlib.h
